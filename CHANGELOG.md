## 1.1.2 - 17 Feb 2022

- Due to potential issues for GHES 3.1â€“3.3 customers who are using recent versions of the CodeQL Action via GHES Connect, the CodeQL Action now uses Node.js v12 rather than Node.js v16. [#937](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/937)

## 1.1.1 - 17 Feb 2022

- The CodeQL CLI versions up to and including version 2.4.4 are not compatible with the CodeQL Action 1.1.1 and later. The Action will emit an error if it detects that it is being used by an incompatible version of the CLI. [#931](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/931)
- Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.1. [#925](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/925)

- Beware that the CodeQL build tracer in this release (and in all earlier releases) is incompatible with Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022. This incompatibility affects database extraction for compiled languages: cpp, csharp, go, and java. As a result, analyzing these languages with the `windows-latest` or `windows-2022` Actions virtual environments is currently unsupported. If you use any of these languages, please use the `windows-2019` Actions virtual environment or otherwise avoid these specific Windows versions until a new release fixes this incompatibility.
